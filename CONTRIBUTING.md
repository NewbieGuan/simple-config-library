# Contributing Guidlines for chimconf
chimconf is designed to be small, lightweight, and header-only. Unless your addition is going to solve world hunger,
make sure additions are as small as possible and can work in a header-only environment. 

Style Guidlines:
- Header file names should end in .hpp
- functions and classes should use snake_case
- functions and classes should use try to use STL functions before using any functionality from other libraries
- COMMENT your code. Explain what you're doing at each major stage of your functions.
- Above all, make sure code is easily readable. I would rather have a slightly larger file size than have to figure out an esoteric decleration or statement.
